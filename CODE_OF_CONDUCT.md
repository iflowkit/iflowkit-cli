# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

We want this community to be welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free for everyone, regardless of background or identity.

## Expected behavior

- Be respectful and considerate in language and actions.
- Assume good intent; seek clarity before escalating.
- Provide constructive feedback focused on the work.
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Keep discussions professional and on-topic.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech
- Personal attacks, insults, or trolling
- Sexualized language or unwelcome sexual attention
- Threats, doxxing, or sharing private information
- Repeated disruptive behavior in discussions or reviews

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including:
- GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and comments
- Community chats (if any), and any other official project channels

## Reporting and enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:
- Contact the repository maintainers via GitHub (for example, via a private message to a repository admin, or by asking for a private reporting channel in Discussions).

Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including:
- Requesting changes to behavior
- Removing content
- Temporarily or permanently restricting participation

## Enforcement guidelines (examples)

Maintainers will consider context and severity. Possible actions:
1. **Correction** – a gentle request to change behavior
2. **Warning** – an explicit notice that behavior must stop
3. **Temporary restriction** – time-limited ban or participation limits
4. **Permanent restriction** – removal from community spaces

## Attribution

This policy is inspired by community best practices for open source projects.
